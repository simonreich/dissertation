abstract ={Although a manipulator must interact with objects in terms of their full complexity, it is the qualitative structure of the objects in an environment and the relationships between them which define the composition of that environment, and allow for the construction of efficient plans to enable the completion of various elaborate tasks. In this paper we present an algorithm which redescribes a scene in terms of a layered representation, from labeled point clouds of the objects in the scene. The representation includes a qualitative description of the structure of the objects, as well as the symbolic relationships between them. This is achieved by constructing contact point networks of the objects, which are topological representations of how each object is used in that particular scene, and are based on the regions of contact between objects. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, by presenting results from the algorithm tested on a database of stereo images. This shows a high percentage of correctly classified relationships, as well as the discovery of interesting topological features. This output provides a layered representation of a scene, giving symbolic meaning to the inter-object relationships useful for subsequent commonsense reasoning and decision making.},

We break down every action into three hierarchical pre-condition layers starting on top with abstract object relations (which need to be fulfilled) and in three steps arriving at the movement primitives required to execute the action. This ontology will then, in the second part of this work, be linked to actual scenes. First the system looks at the scene and for any selected object suggests some actions. One will be chosen and, we use now a simple geometrical reasoning scheme by which this actions movement primitives will be filled with the specific parameter values, which are then executed by the robot. The viability of this approach will be demonstrated by analysing several scenes and a large number of manipulations.}

The filter is first tested on 2d image data and based on the Berkeley Image Dataset and Coco Dataset we outperform other standard methods.

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel edge-preserving texture filter, which smudges the color values inside uniformly textured areas, thus making the processed image more workable for color-based image segmentation. Due to the highly parallel structure of the method, the implementation on a GPU runs in real-time, allowing us to process standard images within tens of milliseconds. By preprocessing images with this novel filter before applying a recent real-time color-based image segmentation method, we obtain significant improvements in performance for images from the Berkeley dataset, outperforming an alternative version using a standard bilateral filter for preprocessing. We further show that our combined approach leads to better segmentations in terms of a standard performance measure than graph-based and mean-shift segmentation for the Berkeley image dataset.}

Furthermore, the device cannot rely on a well ordered or marked surrounding. These requirements make computer vision an important and challenging task for such systems. To cope with the cumulative problems of low frame rates in combination with fast movement of the aerial device, here, a hyperbolic mirror is mounted on top of a quadrocopter, recording omnidirectional images, which can capture features during fast pose changes. In addition, we present a novel approach for embedded low power systems, which we first evaluate on a simulation benchmark. Later, we will demonstrate its viability in a real world scenario.

  abstract = {In order to ensure flight stability in a fast moving quadrotor helicoper a number of typically hand-tuned, interacting PID controllers have to be used. To forego the time consuming tuning process one would like to implement self-tuning controllers. Currently, numerous methods exists based on heuristics, machine learning, or artificial neural networks. However, these algorithms do not take the temporal dynamics of the controlled system into account and thus might move parameters into a long-term unstable regime. To incorporate the concept of these multi-step effects, temporal difference learning based on an actor-critic architecture is utilized. Here, the parametrized PID controller operates as the actor network. Compared to applying a general DDPG algorithm, the here proposed method constrains the search space of possible policies and improves both stability and learning time. On the contrary to a simple PIDNN, the critic allows to evaluate the impact of control inputs further into the future. First, the performance of this algorithm is demonstrated in simulation. Later, results are shown on a fast moving UAV in a real-world environment.},

  abstract = {Even today depth perception in robotic application, e.g. for mapping and navigation, remains a challenging task. While depth aqcuisition via RGB-D cameras is straightforward, real-time analysis on low-power embedded hardware, as it is necessary for truly autonomous robots, has been proven to be difficult due to the huge amount of data. Therefore, in this work a catadioptric setup is used to retrieve a stream of $360^\circ$ RGB images. It is shown that a simple system of a Raspberry Pi and a hyperbolic mirror is capable of calculating the depths of up to 50 features with an error less than 2 percent at 10 FPS. The gained information is used for online vision odometry and SLAM algorithms to achieve autonomous drone navigation and exploration.},
