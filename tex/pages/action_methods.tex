In this section, approaches to planning are introduced.
An overview is given in \figref{fig:actions_methods_flowchart}: First, a) the scene is recorded as RGB-D image by an Asus Xtion Pro camera and a Nikon high resolution \gls{ac:dslr}.
Each depth frame is b) preprocessed by computer vision algorithms.
They are segmented via the Locally Convex Connected Patches (LCCP) algorithm~\cite{stein2014object} into clusters, where each cluster correlates to one object candidate.
For object recognition~\cite{schoeler2014fast} is used; objects are tracked via~\cite{paponkulviciusaksoy2013}. 
All parts of the algorithms are integrated as modular \gls{ac:ros} nodes~\cite{quigleyconleygerkey2009}.
Next, the objects are categorized based on c) an action ontology, \secref{ssec:action_methods_actioncategories}.
This categorization is used throughout the rest of this thesis.
Based on this information, a graph structure is retrieved in d) \acrlong{ac:sec} (\secref{ssec:action_methods_semanticeventchains}).
As first contribution, the graph is enriched with pose information by e) a novel 3d reasoning algorithm (\secref{ssec:action_methods_enrichedsemanticeventchains}).
Afterwards, it is shown in f) that each graph can be reduced to only three different subgraphs (\secref{ssec:action_methods_structuralinformation}).
This in turn is used to compute g) a scene's affordance (\secref{ssec:action_methods_affordanceofsemanticeventchains}).
Here, for example the question is asked: ``Given a tomato, a knife, and a cutting board, what can one do with these objects?''
In h), it is shown how the approach can be extended for complex action planning (\secref{ssec:action_methods_usingaffordanceforplanning}).
As an example it is analyzed what actions a robot needs to perform when given the command ``Make me a sandwich.''
